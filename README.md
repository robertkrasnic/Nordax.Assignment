# Nordax.Assignment

This is a very simple loan flow with an even simpler overview at the end of it. <br>
It is meant to show overall, not specific, knowlage in .Net development with React.js <br>

The solution implements two key functionalities
1. Creating a very simple loan application 
2. Viewing the created/ongoing loan application
<br>
The solution:<br>
 - implements a unitofwork patter<br>
 - also the service patter<br>
 - should show posibility to handel modern day framworks<br>
 - shouold show understanding in EF, .Net and C# <br>

<br>
<br>
Some notes: <br>
 - it took me some time go get started. Installing node.js then running the ClientApp <br>
 - - since the installation installed latest node.js, there was a connection error which was snoosed by changing the line 52 in package.json from <br>
  <code>"start": "rimraf ./build && react-scripts start",</code> to <code>"start": "rimraf ./build && react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start",</code><br>
- did not put effort in doing any Loan related math<br>
- skipped the File upload parts to save time<br>
- skipped unit test to save time<br>


<br>
<br>
This is work was done in 8-10 hours.<br>
No previous React experience.
